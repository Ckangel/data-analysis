# Data-Analysis - Overview
Visualization of data using R language

This project demonstrates my exploration of the **R programming language** through a structured data analysis sprint. As a software engineer, my goal was to deepen my understanding of R’s syntax and libraries while building a reusable workflow for analyzing datasets.  

The software showcases how to:
- Load and clean datasets
- Perform descriptive statistics
- Group and filter data
- Visualize insights with polished plots
- Automate tasks with reusable functions
- Export results into professional reports

My purpose in writing this software was to strengthen my skills in data analysis, visualization, and reproducible reporting. It also serves as a foundation for future projects where R can be applied to real-world datasets.

# Development Environment

- **Tools:** R 4.5.2, RStudio, Visual Studio Code (with R Language extension and `languageserver` for autocompletion)  
- **Programming Language:** R  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `dplyr` for data manipulation  
  - `ggplot2` for visualization  
  - `patchwork` / `gridExtra` for arranging multiple plots  
  - `rmarkdown` for report generation

# Future Work

- Add support for larger, real-world datasets (CSV, JSON, APIs)  
- Expand reusable functions into a mini analysis package  
- Integrate interactive visualizations with `plotly` or `shiny`  
- Automate report generation for multiple datasets  
- Improve error handling and logging in scripts
